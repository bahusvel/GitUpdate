# GitUpdate
Library for software update systems using nothing but GitHub. Manage releases, software or system packages all with automatic updates. A lot of tools, and package managers are written in open source community (on GitHub), and some of them have a plugin system or simply would like to provide updates to their users through some safe and convenient way. Projects such as Homebrew have managed to build their own software update system using GitHub. This is a library that does just that, it provides updates and package management, that you can easily include in your project.
